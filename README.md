NBA Stats
-----------------------

The NBA collects data at the level of individual plays, yet most readily available data are simple summary-level data of each game (box scores). While some data (player location and tracking) are only available by subscription, the NBA offers other interesting data (play-by-play action, shot location) on its website. There are many interesting questions which can be answered with this data -- this repository is a home of methods to gather this data, investigate it, and describe interesting insights gathered.
